Sublimerge
==========

Sublimerge is a Sublime Text 2 plugin which allows to diff and merge files DIRECTLY in the editor using graphical interface for that purpose.

Default key bindings (platform independent):

[ctrl]+[alt]+[d] - open menu to diff the current file to

[ctrl]+[alt]+[,] - merge the change from right to left

[ctrl]+[alt]+[.] - merge the change from left to right

[ctrl]+[alt]+[=] - go to the next difference

[ctrl]+[alt]+[-] - go to the previous difference


Because this is my first Sublime Text 2 plugin and the first Python code I have ever written, probably some things could be done
better. So any feedback is welcome!
